# Space Fighters - C++ Game

### Project Description:
This project demonstrates the use of C++ and the multi-media library SFML to create an engaging two-player space shooter game. In this game, players control starships that shoot blaster shots at each other while navigating a dynamic map filled with portals. These portals add an exciting twist by teleporting or absorbing any shots that pass through them. The game leverages data structures to efficiently manage the positions of players and blaster shots, ensuring smooth updates to the on-screen gameplay.

### How it runs:
This program allows users to interact with the game's objects by pressing designated keys on the keyboard. The game is designed for local multiplayer gameplay, enabling two players to compete against each other on the same computer. During gameplay, players can shoot at each other while simultaneously dodging incoming blaster shots. The portals scattered across the map add an unpredictable element, as they automatically reposition themselves every four seconds. Instead of following a fixed pattern, the portals appear in random locations, keeping players on their toes.

The match continues until one of the players' health reaches zero. Player health is displayed on a sidebar next to the game screen, providing a quick and easy way to track progress.
